 *  LfoGenerator class
 *  This class can be used for each LFO
 *  For this project I will only have one LfoGenerator Object.
 *  
 *  update the knob values of the gLfoAmtPot and lfoFreqPot
 *  this will give you the next scalar (-1 to 1) of LFO
 *  Calculation should happen within a timer interrupt.
 *  getting potentiometer values should happen outside of timer interrupts
 *  
 *  I this project, I am using a ~60Hz timer on TIMER0. I will change recordlength accordingly to this samplerate
